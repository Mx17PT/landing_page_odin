# landing_page_odin

This is the second project in my journey through The Odin Project, It's a simple landing page with a modern style which is built with only HTML and CSS.

This project tries to demonstarte the foundational skills of HTML and CSS that I learn in The Odin Project curriculum until now.

Keep Going..!
